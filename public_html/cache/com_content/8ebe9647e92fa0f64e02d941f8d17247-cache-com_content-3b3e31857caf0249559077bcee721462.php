<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em style="font-size: 12pt;">Spike Jonze&rsquo;s new film &lsquo;Her&rsquo; received an accolade at the 86<sup>th</sup> Academy Award two weeks ago in Los Angeles. In the film we discover that Shanghai embodies L.A.&rsquo;s future in Jonze&rsquo;s imaginary&hellip;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>&nbsp;<img src="https://www.psychologies.co.uk/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/HER_QUAD_AW-low-res_0.gif" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Los Angeles has just recovered from the Oscars 2014. 12 Years of Slave won the prestigious Best Picture Award, Ellen de Generes took the best selfie to date in history and Pharrel&rsquo;s infamous hat even got auctioned for $44100. However, here in IntuuChina, one movie really caught our attention. With 5 nominations and 1 statuette (Best Original Screenplay), &lsquo;Her&rsquo;, directed and written by Spike Jonze is a real jewel. This fantastic sci-fi movie set in Los Angeles follows the tribulations of Theodore Twombly, a heart-broken writer lost in the hustle and bustle of L.A. The film takes us on a futuristic love journey between Theodore and his Operating System. However, the weirdness does not end here. As the camera unveils Theodore&rsquo;s living environment, we are transported in a confusing and dazzling urban environment that does not resemble L.A. at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;<img src="http://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2014/01/her-fp-0835.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="292" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Indeed, Los Angeles&rsquo; future has been projected in another city on the other side of its shore: Shanghai. Our expat eyes were bewildered at the sight of familiar landmarks such as Wujiaochang, the Pudong Sky Bridge and Shanghai metro. The illusion works like wonder, Shanghai blends perfectly into this futuristic imaginary and the New York of the East offers its vibrant energy to this thrilling emotional roller-coaster. Only the Pearl of the Orient has been edited out of the film. Without doubt, it is both an unsettling and crazy feeling to be living in Shanghai&rsquo;s megacity that represents the future of such a famous city like L.A. It really comforts us in our Intuuchina belief that China truly embodies the vision of a promising future, an opinion clearly shared by Jonze&rsquo;s imaginary as proven by this bold cinematographic choice. If you live in Shanghai, &lsquo;Her&rsquo; will certainly make you proud. If you do not live here (yet), you will be mesmerized by Shanghai&rsquo;s architecture and be pressed by an urge to come visit and why not settle here&hellip;</span></p>
