<p>Turn your Internship into a Full-time Job</p>
<p>So you aced the interview and accepted the internship offer. Whether you are doing an internship for school credit or just to gain relevant skills in your field of study, you should make the most of it. It&rsquo;s best if you think of your internship as a probation period with the possibility of getting hired because companies often hire their interns as it saves time and money. Keep in mind that they see how you perform, whether you&rsquo;ve gained experience and have proved yourself on the job, especially during long-term internships. They will be more likely to hire you after your internship ends or think of you when there is an open position.<br />Having internship experience listed on your CV lets your employers know that you have the skills required of a full-time job in your related field of study. The following are some tips to keep in mind to leverage your internship into a full-time job.<br />1. Schedule a meeting time with your supervisor: Interview them and tell them what you want. If you like where the company is going and see yourself working there, tell them so. Ask for feedback on your work and what areas you could improve on.<br />2. Be a sponge: Coming into a company as an intern means its okay to ask as many questions as you want since this will be your first exposure to a real working environment. Keep a notebook with you to write everything down. Watch and learn, you may even ask if you could shadow someone and get involved in other departments during downtime.<br />3. Act like a full-time employee: Even though you&rsquo;re an intern you&rsquo;re still expected to act professionally. Dress accordingly to the company's dress code (if there is one) and follow office hours. Treat every employee you meet with respect and professionalism; avoid any negative comments or gossip..<br />4. Network: Even though you&rsquo;re an intern and may feel like you&rsquo;re at the bottom of the barrel, don't be shy about interacting with your full-time colleagues. Use this internship opportunity to connect with senior leaders and your fellow interns; add them on Linkedin. These vital contacts can serve as references, write recommendations for you and keep you up to date on any job opening. Attend any social events and outings where you can take the chance to ask what they like about working in the company or sector and what they don&rsquo;t like about it. It&rsquo;s also a great way to find a mentor.<br />5. Be Enthusiastic: Even though some tasks may be tedious tackle them with enthusiasm. Start your day with coffee if you&rsquo;re not a morning person. Nobody wants to work with someone that&rsquo;s lacking in energy and brings the office down.<br />6. Show Initiative: Stay active and when you feel yourself getting too comfortable surfing the web, ask other departments if they need help. Not only will it make a great impression on your colleagues (everyone appreciates a helping hand!) but it will also sharpen and expand your skills. Prove that you can meet and go well beyond the responsibilities of what your internship entails. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to bring up problems (with solutions) that haven&rsquo;t been addressed yet.<br />7. Develop a Strong Work Ethic: Having integrity helps foster meaningful relationships with clients and colleagues. Have some discipline and be responsible for your day to day tasks. Show your supervisor you can work well to meet the demands of the company, individually and in a team.<br />With these tips in mind you may be able to turn your internship into a full-time position or at least make a good impression for a stellar recommendation.
