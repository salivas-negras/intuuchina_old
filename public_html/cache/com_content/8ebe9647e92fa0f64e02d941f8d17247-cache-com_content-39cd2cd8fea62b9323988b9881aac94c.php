<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">Interviews are a play of strategy. Employer and potential-hire rally questions and answers trying to best the other with the element of surprise. It&rsquo;s the interviewer designing the question to test the interviewee&rsquo;s spontaneous critical thinking and personality under stress.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the interviewee practicing the most creative answer of where he or she will be in 10 years.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, it comes down to more than what either party says, it&rsquo;s the flow of the conversation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">In a candid style, Jeff Harden of Inc. Magazine outlines &lsquo;9 Things Every Interviewer Wishes You Knew&rsquo; </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">I want you to be likeable. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">I don&rsquo;t want you to immediately say you want the job.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">I want you to stand out&hellip;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">&hellip;but not for being negative.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">I want you to ask a lot of questions about what really matters to you&hellip;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">&hellip;but only if the majority of those questions relate to real work.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">I love when you bring a &lsquo;project.&rsquo;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">At the end I want you to ask for the job&hellip;and I want to know why. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">I want you to follow up&hellip;especially if it&rsquo;s genuine. </span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">Sounds intense&hellip;but don&rsquo;t let it scare you. Our job at <strong><span style="color: red;">Intuu</span>China</strong> is to interview clients for the purpose of getting them interviews, so we&rsquo;re quite used to this beast.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">We really enjoyed his piece and wanted to share it with you (find the full text here </span><a href="http://linkd.in/1lmZKVC"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">http://linkd.in/1lmZKVC</span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">).&nbsp; Two things that resonated most with us was the need to have made the job application personal and difference between being the &lsquo;impressive&rsquo; and the &lsquo;polite&rsquo; candidate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">For the first, Harden repeats that applicants should be knowledgeable of the company to the extent that they could ask specific questions about the role and company.&nbsp; He specifies that these questions are not about benefits or hours but rather, company goals, manager expectations and how you will be evaluated.&nbsp; Additionally, he says the best candidates will be able to suggest a new company project that utilizes their past work skills. Also, he notes that interviewees should not immediately state that they want the job&mdash;he says eagerness can be mistaken for flippancy.&nbsp; Hardin suggests asserting your desire for the job at the end of the interview and in the follow-up</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">Second, Harden details that candidates who have unique personalities will come to be known by those traits during the interview process.&nbsp; He says that an interviewee&rsquo;s impression lasts longer than a CV and candidates should be personable.&nbsp; Additionally, the post-interview follow-up is also critically important but the generic &lsquo;Please advise if you need more information&rsquo; message is not going to cut it.&nbsp; Referencing conversation points from the interview shows your engagement in the process and commitment ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 	</div>
