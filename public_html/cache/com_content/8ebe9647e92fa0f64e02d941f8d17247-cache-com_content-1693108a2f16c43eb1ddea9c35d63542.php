<p><strong>Tailor made program</strong><br />Do you have specific requests? An upcoming HSK exam? A business meeting to prepare for? A course exam you need to pass? We can tailor a program for you based on your requirements. Let us know what you need and how much time you have, and we will create the perfect program for you.</p>
<p><br /><strong>One on one lessons</strong><br />For more intensive learning, you can sign up for one-on-one lessons with our teachers. This is especially helpful if you are looking to improve your Mandarin extra quickly or if you have special requirements for your classes that don&rsquo;t match well with group classes. One-on-one lessons can either be an addition to your group classes or can be a program in itself.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Corporate training</strong><br />As a professional in China, you are not only in a different cultural environment, you are in an environment where your existing language skills might not be enough for your business needs. Some things just don&rsquo;t translate well, so being able to speak to your clients and partners in their native language will prove a great advantage. We cater to all levels of corporate learners, whether you are newly arrived in China and need to learn the very basics of the language or you are a veteran who is now looking to take your Mandarin Chinese to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Why choose us</strong><br />At IntuuChina we have already helped over 200 people to find their way in China. We know first hand the challenges you might face and we know how to overcome them. Get in touch, tell us what you are looking for and our team will do our outmost to make all your China dreams come true.</p>
