<p>While discussing with our HR department the importance of job interviews, we wondered about how job interviews came to be. A simple Google search led us to this footage from prehistoric times! Watch how job interviews were an essential part of figuring out who could help your tribe survive, much like today.</p>
<p>Although a comedy sketch taking place in hunting and gathering times, the simplified questions asked are references to questions we ask today.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What you do?&rdquo; &ndash; What are your skills? What skills do you have that we lack/need?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Where you see yourself in fifty moons times?&rdquo; &ndash; Where do you see yourself in 5 &ndash; 10 years? This is another question that is important to the tribe or company. They want a long-term commitment, someone they spend resources training in order to help them succeed years to come.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why you leave last tribe?&rdquo; &ndash; This question is sometimes asked before the interview, when you apply. If you got fired or left after just two years to travel (as this hunter and gather did) the company wants to know. Again, they don&rsquo;t want to waste their time and resources on someone who is going to leave spontaneously. Another issue this sketch points out in a hilarious way &ndash; do not lie. It&rsquo;s a small world, especially now with the invention of the World Wide Web.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Me Late. CV broke&rdquo; &ndash; Though not a question an interviewer asks, make sure to always be prepared. Don&rsquo;t show up late and then forget to bring your resume or any other paper work they may have asked of you prior your scheduled interview.</li>
</ul>
