		<p>IntuuChina is proud of the community that we are building and all the people who are part of it. Our priority is to these individuals. Setting a path for them to follow ensures that every member stays focused and doesn&rsquo;t lose their way. Giving them guidance allows them to see what is down the road and prepares them for any challenge. Setting up signposts and milestones gives them the confidence to keep moving forward and most importantly allows them to enjoy the journey and fall in love with China, the ancient middle nation that to them is a new world of possibilities.</p>
<p>This is the core of our vision. We want to make sure that these ideals are represented at all times and stress that our service is primarily guidance. An important part of that message is the IntuuChina logo. The first thing that people will see and the image that will be synonymous with IntuuChina must convey this story. To tell our story Manuel Palhinha designed a logo that was inspired by China&rsquo;s rich history and guiding principles.</p>
<p>China is our land of opportunity. It is the dragon that when we tame will allow us entry into a new world. We must explore this new world using a map. The focus of our logo is a map which was designed by people who have successfully navigated China and now guide those who come after.</p>
<p>For thousands of years the Chinese lantern has been a guiding light. The earliest of all portable guiding devices, it uses the color red to bring good fortune and joy on the roads we travel. The lantern changes from bright to dark as the traveler continues on his journey. This light is a source of comfort as it illuminates the path and exposes any obstacles. Our logo uses these shades of red in the same way as the lantern making the road safe for anyone who holds it.</p>
<p>The arrow shows our destination. It is the final goal and the end of our travels. Broken down to its simplest form the arrow is a triangle that represents our ambitions. The map that is the IntuuChina logo uses triangles to show the many different destinations of our lives and the various approaches we can take.</p>
<p>These represent our professional goals but IntuuChina believes there is more to be gained than career growth. To achieve any kind of growth there must be personal fulfillment. China offers insights and reflections that deepen our understanding of the world and ourselves. It challenges us in unexpected ways that creates a drive to succeed and makes any roadblock a joy to overcome. This is the real reason we fall in love with China and is represented by the grey elements in the IntuuChina logo. Forming a heart reminds us of the human aspect of our careers and the emotional connections that shape us. In its entirety we are inspired to be INTO other options, IN for a greater journey, willing to change TO other contexts, being IntuuChina.</p>	</div>

		<p>Turn your Internship into a Full-time Job</p>
<p>So you aced the interview and accepted the internship offer. Whether you are doing an internship for school credit or just to gain relevant skills in your field of study, you should make the most of it. It&rsquo;s best if you think of your internship as a probation period with the possibility of getting hired because companies often hire their interns as it saves time and money. Keep in mind that they see how you perform, whether you&rsquo;ve gained experience and have proved yourself on the job, especially during long-term internships. They will be more likely to hire you after your internship ends or think of you when there is an open position.<br />Having internship experience listed on your CV lets your employers know that you have the skills required of a full-time job in your related field of study. The following are some tips to keep in mind to leverage your internship into a full-time job.<br />1. Schedule a meeting time with your supervisor: Interview them and tell them what you want. If you like where the company is going and see yourself working there, tell them so. Ask for feedback on your work and what areas you could improve on.<br />2. Be a sponge: Coming into a company as an intern means its okay to ask as many questions as you want since this will be your first exposure to a real working environment. Keep a notebook with you to write everything down. Watch and learn, you may even ask if you could shadow someone and get involved in other departments during downtime.<br />3. Act like a full-time employee: Even though you&rsquo;re an intern you&rsquo;re still expected to act professionally. Dress accordingly to the company's dress code (if there is one) and follow office hours. Treat every employee you meet with respect and professionalism; avoid any negative comments or gossip..<br />4. Network: Even though you&rsquo;re an intern and may feel like you&rsquo;re at the bottom of the barrel, don't be shy about interacting with your full-time colleagues. Use this internship opportunity to connect with senior leaders and your fellow interns; add them on Linkedin. These vital contacts can serve as references, write recommendations for you and keep you up to date on any job opening. Attend any social events and outings where you can take the chance to ask what they like about working in the company or sector and what they don&rsquo;t like about it. It&rsquo;s also a great way to find a mentor.<br />5. Be Enthusiastic: Even though some tasks may be tedious tackle them with enthusiasm. Start your day with coffee if you&rsquo;re not a morning person. Nobody wants to work with someone that&rsquo;s lacking in energy and brings the office down.<br />6. Show Initiative: Stay active and when you feel yourself getting too comfortable surfing the web, ask other departments if they need help. Not only will it make a great impression on your colleagues (everyone appreciates a helping hand!) but it will also sharpen and expand your skills. Prove that you can meet and go well beyond the responsibilities of what your internship entails. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to bring up problems (with solutions) that haven&rsquo;t been addressed yet.<br />7. Develop a Strong Work Ethic: Having integrity helps foster meaningful relationships with clients and colleagues. Have some discipline and be responsible for your day to day tasks. Show your supervisor you can work well to meet the demands of the company, individually and in a team.<br />With these tips in mind you may be able to turn your internship into a full-time position or at least make a good impression for a stellar recommendation. IntuuChina can help you achieve and build your successful job career through monthly mentorships and coaching.</p>
<p>The following are some tips to practice in order to leverage your internship into a full-time position after your internship contract ends..</p>	</div>

		<p>What inspired this post was my observation of how long people spend several months or even years trying to find work in their home country for several months or even years.</p>
<p>The truth is I could write a book telling you all about my different anecdotes on interviews, internship requirements, and job searches and so on. Nonetheless, I am going to focus on a few tips I have come up with for recent grads or those in their last year of college, with or without work experience and multiple languages under their belt.</p>
<p>The context in which all this takes place is in Spain. Many already know that the country is going through an economic crisis, where unemployment is at 25.1% (source: http://www.datosmacro.com/paro/espana) and is affecting many young people.</p>
<p>The disappointment is widespread across classrooms in schools where people are beginning to wonder if they should leave school and work in a field not related to their studies since their prospective outlook doesn&rsquo;t have a good future. Anybody can be influenced by this atmosphere of negativity but there are others who are taking the bull by the horns by searching for opportunities in other countries.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself and do research:</p>
<p>1. Set a goal: Despite the obstacles you will come across or if your goal is no attainable in the short term, do not deviate! Keep your long term goal in mind and strive for it.<br />2. Invest in your education: Just because you&rsquo;ve finished your bachelor degree that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve successfully completed your part. Take extra curriculum courses to complement your studies. When was the last time you took English? Retake some courses!<br />3. Personal Brand: Think of all your different interests and see how they match with your studies to have an idea about that dream job you can have personally and professionally. Work on your personal brand so that others can have a coherent image of who you are and what you stand for.<br />4. Professional Internships: There are different types of internships, those where you can actually learn and grow in the company (a minority) and those where interns work the coffee machine and photocopier and have no opportunities of advancement.</p>
<p>Internships Abroad:</p>
<p>If you want to be among the first group of interns, prepare your suitcase and your academic and professional background and go abroad! You can do your research online from your home country or jump on a flight to find work on your own in said country. The process can be long, difficult and frustrating or you can find someone to look work for you.</p>
<p>"Craziest thing I&rsquo;ve heard!" you think. I do not intend to encourage idleness or laziness on your part. The upside of contacting someone to search for employment opportunities for you is that there are people more efficient at finding companies offering internship opportunities that offer personal and professional growth within the company.</p>
<p>I do encourage the idea of finding the resources that guarantees an internship abroad, without having to go through the seemingly never-ending selection processes of different companies. Instead it only takes a free Skype consultation and these HR recruiters will take care of matching your profile with current open internship positions. Aside from offering internship positions with high possibility of promotion, these positions offer experience that can help you gain quality skills in a very short period of time (3-6 months). You will also have real responsibilities in your day-to-day internship where the only coffee that you&rsquo;ll be making will be yours!</p>
<p>So how would your life be if someone else sought out the ideal job for you?</p>	</div>

		<p>Guanxi (关系) is at the very center of how the Chinese handle business. Foreigners who want to take advantage of China&rsquo;s booming economy must build guanxi with their business partners or they will have very temporary results if any at all. When the full concept is understood, acquiring guanxi might seem like common sense but to us foreigners who still have the wrong impression, the process can be intimidating. Looking back it is often easier to see our mistakes and not recognize our success so, with that in mind, here is a list of things to AVOID guanxi.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T learn Chinese. This one is easy. If you don&rsquo;t want to have a lasting business relationship, don&rsquo;t bother learning the language of your partners. It is still possible to make deals and agreements through English, the language of business, but these will be one-shot deals. You and your Chinese counterpart will remain names on a business card. Also, try to learn up to 10 words in the local dialect. Every region in China has its own peculiarities and knowing simple phrases never fails to impress. Even many Chinese don&rsquo;t know other dialects so being a foreigner with even the slightest familiarity will generate great interest as well as appreciation.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T participate in any Chinese social media (Wechat, Weibo, QQ). These apps and social media are reserved for friends and close contacts and are often the main source of communication between two people. Aside from personal communication it is also an integral part of a business strategy. Weibo has 600 million registered users so if you want exposure in China it is an absolute must.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T learn Chinese songs. This one may be a bit confusing for someone who has never been to China where karaoke is one of, if not the most, popular leisure activity. It is the most likely place your business partners will invite you and is a great chance to impress. If you know one single Chinese song from beginning to end you will make a very strong and lasting impression. It shows that you understand that singing is important to them as a people and that you took the time to learn a song that was part of their tradition instead of yours.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T befriend any Chinese. This one, again, seems obvious but it is very easy to find a group of other foreigners and become close with them. Especially in Shanghai and Beijing living in a bubble is very easy to do, meeting people from all over the West. Of course you may meet some great people but to get ahead in China you need to get out of your comfort zone. The habits and norms of a night out with Chinese can be very different and you want to learn these and show that you are already familiar with a local&rsquo;s night out.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T celebrate any Chinese holidays. This is a big one because we often feel intimidated by the family nature of these events and don&rsquo;t want to intrude but this is one of the best ways to show someone you care about them and that you understand and respect their culture. It should be said that it isn&rsquo;t necessary to stress over all the details of etiquette. As a foreigner the Chinese understand that you are not familiar with their culture and they will not be offended by these minor infractions but this also poses a great opportunity to impress. If you show that you understand their celebrations you will definitely leave a lasting impression. A large part of any celebration is the &ldquo;Hongbao&rdquo;. This is a red envelope with money inside given as a gift. To foreigners it may feel strange giving money but in China it is a tradition and also a direct sign of how closely you care about someone. Another large part of any celebration is food and there is always a specific dish involved for each holiday or celebration. Find out what it is and bring some as a gift. Not only will they appreciate any gift but they will be astonished to receive the appropriate gift from a foreigner. At meals pay respect to elders and wait to eat before they have had their fill. Again, this simple gesture shows you have taken the time to learn about your hosts and their culture.</p>
<p>If this all seems like common sense to you, you&rsquo;re right. This advice on what NOT to do should seem pretty intuitive but it is easy to be intimidated by China and it is easy to live in a comfortable bubble of foreign restaurants, bars and hangouts that prevent you from integrating with China. To acquire guanxi and become truly successful in China you need to get out of your comfort zone and make an effort to understand the people. Nothing is more flattering than knowing that someone understands and respects who you are and where you came from. You will find a business relationship will turn into a prosperous, lifelong friendship. Take the time to learn about a people and the return on your investment will be enormous.</p>	</div>

		<p>They believe in honesty. They believe in challenge. They believe in tough love. They are mentors. In a world that seems to be filled with closed doors and inaccessible groups, guidance can be hard to come by. Business can be very competitive and cut-throat but not everyone is looking to take advantage of you. There are people who want to share their expertise and prove to be one of the most valuable resources available to a young professional who is trying to make it in the business world.</p>
<p>From the CEO of TD Bank to the founder of Tim Horton&rsquo;s there are many high-profile, successful businessmen who have become mentors. Andrew Carnegie, America&rsquo;s steel baron and business tycoon, mentored Charles Schwab who became equally successful having ushered in the age of the skyscraper with his now ubiquitous I-beam steel bar. Advice that is now famous and used as common nuggets of wisdom have their origins in discussions between mentors and their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, most notably &ldquo;surround yourself with people who are smarter than you&rdquo; which was told to George Steinbrenner, owner of The New York Yankees (which people have joked was very easy for Steinbrenner to do).</p>
<p>The reasons for becoming a mentor may not be obvious but there are many. It helps bridge a generational gap that may seem elusive to someone higher up in an industry. Having a prot&eacute;g&eacute; allows a mentor to understand the new generation&rsquo;s motives, goals and ambitions and improve his own career with these insights. An experienced person can identify the stars of the next generation and show them how to handle tough situations and help them grow into an employee that has both professional and personal standards. Most importantly it carries on a tradition that dates back to the ancient Greeks and fulfills a fundamental desire to form meaningful, productive relationships.</p>
<p>A prot&eacute;g&eacute; has the distinct advantage of learning first hand. Most people learn through a process of trial and error which takes time and produces results that are sometimes harmful to their self-confidence, drive and ambition. Having a mentor will shorten the learning curve and give a boost to the lessons learned in any experience. In all aspects of life it is good to have someone to talk through issues. Sometimes just stating an issue out loud helps make a problem clearer in our minds. Having a mentor enables you to do this on a regular basis and receive feedback from an experienced source that can be trusted to represent your interests.</p>
<p>Here at IntuuChina we have found this relationship produces results that go beyond the office and create some of the most well rounded professionals in the workplace. Our partners at CWCC Latin Department have found it to be equally valuable especially between two people of different cultural backgrounds. The following link is a story of a man from Colombia who was fortunate to find a mentor in Hong Kong who helped bridge cultural gaps and achieve a greater potential than he thought possible.</p>	</div>
