                <div class="uk-margin"><p>In just two words: great service! I came to Shanghai 6 months ago and Intuuchina found me a challenging internship in a Chinese consulting company. Whenever I had an issue regarding my job or my situation, they took time for me to find th e best solution for my needs. They even made me feel at home, even if this country was completely unfamiliar, especially during the first months. I strongly recommend IntuuChina to anyone who wants to improve their professional career.</p></div>

                <div class="uk-margin"><p>In my country of origin, I could not get interesting work opportunities. Due to the stagnant labor market in European countries, the opportunities were almost inexistent, not very interesting and had little responsibility. My internship in Shanghai started in March through IntuuChina and until now I have tried to learn, work hard and enjoy this wonderful city. I am very thankful for the chance IntuuChina has given me, for their support along the way and for providing me the opportunity to be part of their program.</p></div>
