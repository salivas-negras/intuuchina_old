<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">Hooray! Don&rsquo;t judge us too much if we congratulate ourselves&hellip;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">We&rsquo;ve been featured in B-UIC Magazine published by the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences (FCES) at the Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC) in Barcelona, Spain.&nbsp; As our founders all hail from Barcelona, and Marc Ramon Hernadez graduated from the esteemed UIC, we are flattered by the attention and honored to be a window into Chinese business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">In the article Hernandez and Fernando de Zavala, two of three founders, are interviewed about their work experience in China and their motivation to start <strong><span style="color: red;">Intuu</span>China</strong>.&nbsp; Hernandez and de Zavala explain that <strong><span style="color: red;">Intuu</span>China</strong>, which offers post-arrival support, personalized placement and business mentors, serves a niche in the China recruiting market: &ldquo;We immediately realized that these [other headhunting companies] were selling their practices as an isolated service and they were placing you in companies that were not really your objective&hellip;we realized that if the two market leaders were providing a service that was below expectations, then there was a need there, a gap to be filled.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">Throughout the post, Hernandez and de Zavala mention their own personal experiences studying and working in China, careful to point out differences with other parts of the world. A key point is the intensity of business relationship.&nbsp; Unlike the West, which relies on business networking as a pool of skills, business contacts are much more familial in China.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">Hernandez explains the need for &lsquo;guanxi&rsquo; the unique word to describe the Chinese corporate kin-like relationship.&nbsp; He remembers the difficulty of beginning a career in China without having his own &lsquo;guanxi&rsquo;: the main drawback [to working in China] is that it is very difficult to establish commercial relationships and not to be passed over if you don&rsquo;t have a good position, work in a good company or have not obtained a first introduction through someone trusted by the person you want to be introduced to.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">We&rsquo;re so proud of Marc and pleased with the story because it showcases our team&rsquo;s knowledge of working in China.&nbsp; Additionally, the piece illustrates our eagerness to connect students and young professionals to this part of the world so that they can experience dynamic market for themselves.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;">Please find a link to the entire magazine and full version of the story appearing on pages 27-28 via this link: </span><a href="http://www.uic.es/en/b-uic"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria; color: #103cc0;">http://www.uic.es/en/b-uic</span></a></span></p> 	</div>
