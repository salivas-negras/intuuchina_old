		<p><span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Today, most schools, public administration and some Chinese businesses will close their doors. China starts celebrating a 3 day observance for the annual Qing Ming festival. The day was usually celebrated in Macau and Hong Kong and has become an official holiday in mainland China in 2008. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">清明节 (Qīngm&iacute;ng Ji&eacute;), literally translated as clear and bright festival is also know as &lsquo;Tomb Sweeping Festival&rsquo;. You may have noticed, temperatures are raising, trees are blossoming and the spring spirit brings a smooth transition into summer after a rude and cold winter. The festival is the most appropriate moment for family to gather around their ancestor&rsquo;s tomb and pay tribute to their lives and hope that good fortune will come for the living ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">At IntuuChina for instance, our employee Irene will set sail for a long journey to the outskirts of Shanghai from 5AM. Apart from cleaning the tomb and offering wine and food to the deceased, one of the most striking feature of QingMing festival is the burning of fake banknotes and small artefacts made with cardboard and paper such as fake luxury bags, ipads, houses, pricey shoes and even houses. After a morning of commemoration, the family will then eat in a restaurant. They will then gather around 青团 (qīngtu&aacute;n), a steamed gelatinous green bun filled with a sweet red bean paste. The day can be a very intense emotional journey but the family bounds grow stronger. Chinese would also fly kites and attach little paper lamps during the dark hours. Overall, it is a fun day of remembrance and paring respect to the deceased.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"></span><span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Wondering how the burnt paper object look like? As a bonus, here is the art project of Item Idem, a French artist from New York. He composed a stunning video, with Chinese artist Cheng Ran, displaying those objects exploding and catching fire in a dramatic way.</span></p>

		<div>
		<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">You just arrived from a long international journey and your eyes are barely alert and probably confused by the Chinese signs everywhere. No worries, we have prepared a comprehensive list of your transfer options from Shanghai airports to the city Centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">From Pudong Airport</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Pudong is divided between two international terminals. If you are landing and want to make your way to the city, no need to acknowledge where you are landing. However, if you are leaving from Pudong, make sure you know which Terminal your airline is flying from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- The Metro &ndash; 6RMB</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Line 2 will become your best friend. It takes approximately 45 minutes to join the city centre. &nbsp;Rather than standing in the line to take a metro ticket, buy a shanghai metro card (20RMB = 3euros) and top it up with the amount you want. It is a simple pay as you go card that will save you a lot of time when metro stations machines will be busy. As an indication, a metro ride in Shanghai costs approximately 3-4RMB. Also, do not be surprised but you will have to change&nbsp; carriages at Guanglan Road to continue to the city centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- The Maglev &ndash; 40RMB+costs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Ever dreamt of riding the 30 km (19mi) to the city centre in 6-7 minutes? It is possible if you take the Maglev. The Maglev operates between 6.45 to 21.40It does not land you exactly in the city centre but at Longyang Road Station from where you will have to take the line 2 or taxi to arrive at your final destination. The L.E.D. speedometer is an attraction as it quickly reaches the maximum speed of 431 km/h (268 mph). Be aware that the maximum speed is only reached between 9.00-10.45 and 15.00-15.45 due to noise restrictions. A fun way to save time to the centre!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- Taxi &ndash; On the meter</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Taxi Lines are well organized from Pudong. Journey fares start with a flat rate of 14RMB (April 2014) daytime and 18RMB nighttime. You should pay between 120-180RMB to reach most parts of Shanghai. Taxis in Shanghai are always on the meter!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- Arriving late</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Some flights arrive very late and transportation gets very difficult past 23.00. If you are on a budget and do not want to take the taxi, take the special night bus line. The last bus will depart 45 minutes after the last plane arrives. It goes to all these stations: Longyang Road Subway Station, Dongfang Rd Zhangyang Rd, East Hospital (Pudong Avenue), Middle Zhejiang Rd (Yan'an Rd/People's Square), Shimen 1st Rd (Yan'an Rd), Huashan Rd (Yan'an Rd/Jing'an Temple), Hongxu Rd (Yan'an Rd)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">From Hongqiao</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hongqiao is more famous for its domestic connections but if you were in transit somewhere else, you might end up at Hongqiao, Shanghai&rsquo;s first airport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- The Metro &ndash; Line 2 and Line 10</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Both tube lines connect the airport to most places in the city centre. You can also take line 2 to go to Pudong airport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- Taxi</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Same as for Pudong, it is very convenient to take the taxi from Hongqiao. As the airport is closer to the centre, it should cost you around 40-60RMB to join most places in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Don&rsquo;t forget to note down your final destination&rsquo;s address in Chinese and print of map of Shanghai&rsquo;s tube and a google maps prints of the surroundings of your accommodation would not hurt either.

		<div>
		<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Learning Chinese is not as daunting as one can possibly imagine. The grammatical structure is easy. Of course the two main obstacles are the tones which can prove to hear, let alone reproduce and, of course, the learning of the characters. There is indeed, no alphabet but you will see that after learning a few characters, a logic will emerge and stems, radicals and concepts will help you remember characters in a fun and sustainable way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">1. Rejoice, Chinese is not as difficult!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Great news! There is no single conjugation pattern to learn. All verbs are expressed in the same manner. The future and the past are expressed simply by adding adverbs or adverbial phrases such as &lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo; (<span>明天－</span>m&iacute;ngtiān), &lsquo;last year&rsquo;<span>（去年</span>-q&ugrave;ni&aacute;n<span>）</span>, &lsquo;yesterday&rsquo;<span>（昨天</span>-zu&oacute;tiān<span>）</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2. But let&rsquo;s be realistic</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It is believed that in order to read the newspapers, one must learn 3000 characters. There are some irregularities, one single character can be pronounced differently, have several meanings and depending if you are from the North or the South, things are expressed differently. This are quite common variations that actually exists in all languages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">3. One word a day keeps the boredom away</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Learning a language demands discipline. Rest assured, nothing too time-consuming but a 10-20 minutes session everyday will truly help you memorise the characters, as they have to be saved in your long-term memory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">4. Use your imagination</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Once you have acquired some basic characters, use your imagination and learn how stems and radicals do offer some great combinations in order to produce meaning. Chinese is a real language.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">5. Use Pleco!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are some brilliants apps on the market. Pleco (<a href="https://www.pleco.com/">https://www.pleco.com/</a>) is one of them. It contains an impressive range of entries English-Chinese and vice versa. It offers you the ability to test yourself and see statistics of your progression!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">6. Create colourful memories Chineasy (<a href="http://chineasy.org/">http://chineasy.org/</a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If you are a visual person, attracted to beautiful things, this method will be your heaven. Combining characters with simple illustration Shaolan &ndash; at the root of this social teaching initiative &ndash; has managed to create simple Chinese flashcards that will stick in your mind forever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">7. Feed your Facebook wall</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">All About Chinese (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/allaboutchinese">https://www.facebook.com/allaboutchinese</a>). For your daily fix of cheesy Chinese quotes, this is just a perfect stream of updates</span></li>

<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Chinese HSK apps (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChineseHSKapps">https://www.facebook.com/ChineseHSKapps</a>). A great way to learn grammar and</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">8. And on Twitter</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">@ChineseHSKapps</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">@Hello_Chineasy</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">@ChineseHSKapps</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9. Watch Chinese movies</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Time Out just realeased an impressive list of the 100 best mainland China film to watch! Watching movies is a great way to get accustomed to the language, hear patterns and even</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/feature/1031/The-100-best-Mainland-Chinese-films.html">http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/feature/1031/The-100-best-Mainland-Chinese-films.html</a><a href="http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/feature/1031/The-100-best-Mainland-Chinese-films.html"></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">10. Keep faith</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Learning Chinese is probably the most rewarding thing ever. You will have access to a complete whole new world of opportunities and it is incredible how helpful this language will prove to you in the long-run. The more you learn, the more friends you will be able to make. This will allow you to create a long-term, sustainable, virtuous learning circle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Good luck !</span></p>	</div>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="images/Totems-by-Alain-Delorme-3.jpg" alt="Totems-by-Alain-Delorme-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">1 &ndash; Install a VPN</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A VP-What? You may ask. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network aka magic that will make blocked websites such as Facebook, Youtube, the NYT available to you in mainland China.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On MAC and PCs, most of the reliable VPNs are not free. We recommend Astrill. With prices ranging from little as $5.83 to $9.98 per month with plans ranging from 3 months to 1 year. It&rsquo;s a fast and reliable VPN which even displays the upload and download speed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Also, do not forget your phones! As we are consuming most of our media on the go, it is important to install those VPNs on your cell phone before you arrive in China. Try Onavo Protect (free) for IOS and VPN unlimited (Android)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2 - Fight the language barrier</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Everything will be different! The signs on the street, the price tags in supermarkets and even letters in your mailbox! Don&rsquo;t miss out on anything and install a dictionary on your phones. Make sure you have enabled Chinese Pinyin keyboard and Chinese Writing keyboard in your phone settings and indulge yourself in the Chinese language. It is truly mesmerising. We highly recommend Pleco which will also allow you to save and organise new words and even test yourself on them! A great app on both IOS and Android.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">3- Communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Start your China immersion with social media! Download WeChat aka Weixin <span>微信</span>. It is a cross over between Whatsapp and Facebook. A very communication tool that everyone use in China! It will help you a lot meeting new friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Also, if you can, business cards are always a handy thing to have. It is very common to exchange them when you first meet someone. Please remember to receive and give your business card with two hands, thumbs facing the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">4 &ndash; Eating customs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As non-obvious as it may sound, make sure you know how to use chopsticks before coming to China. Little cantine and street food will certainly not cater for forks and knifes lovers. Also, it is not impolite to sip your soup loudly! So don&rsquo;t be too surprised! ;)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">5 &ndash; Taking the taxi</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Very few taxi drivers speak English. Make sure to give the nearest intersection name rather than the full address to the taxi. For example, if you would like to go to do your grocery shopping at the Avocado Lady on Wulumuqi Road, you have to tell the taxi first the road where you want to go here Wulumuqi Road and the nearest intersection Wuyuan Road. So, you would say: Wulumuqi Lu/Wuyuan Lu and that&rsquo;s enough for the taxi to depart! Oh yeah Lu = Road in Chinese.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">6 &ndash; Stay safely hydrated</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Water is non-potable in China. Make sure you always buy water bottles. It is very easy to find and cheap! Also, when you ask for tap water at the restaurant, you will most likely end up with hot water which is safe but also healthy to drink according to Chinese sayings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">7 &ndash; Road Safety</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Although this is pretty obvious, there are some uncommon features of Chinese road customs. For instance, when you are on a pedestrian crossing and the little man turned green, be aware that vehicles at any intersection will always have the possibility to turn right despite being faced by a red light. More than ever, look both sides before engaging on the road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">8 &ndash; You might miss&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&hellip; deodorant and tampons. Make sure you stock up on those items, as they don&rsquo;t really exist for the wider public. Moreover they are a weeny bit more expensive in China.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9 &ndash; Survival phrases</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>我要</span><span>这</span><span>个</span> = wo y&agrave;o zh&egrave;ge = I want this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please also use your fingers to point to the stuff you want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>不要／要</span><span>＝</span>b&ugrave;yāo/yāo = I don&rsquo;t want / I want</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>不要辣</span><span>＝</span>b&ugrave;yāo l&agrave; = I don&rsquo;t want spicy (very useful if you don&rsquo;t want to eat spicy food)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">10 &ndash; Open your eyes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Don&rsquo;t forget that you are coming to China to experience another culture. You will be truly amazed by where curiosity can take you. Despite the language barrier, it is possible to meet native Chinese and become good friends with them. &nbsp;Remain open.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"></span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">3. The person who sits closest to the drink, should pour it for others. From the other side, when others fill your cup or glass, you should express your thanks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">4. The host should toast others first with a simple prologue to let the dining start. During the dinner, anyone can toast you or vice versa. When someone toasts you, you have to stop eating and drinking to accept and toast in response. If the person you want to toast, you can rap on the table to attract attention rather than shout during the dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Calibri;">5. It is not usual to finish all the dishes on the table since that is considered that the host did not provide enough food. All guests should leave the table after the host.</span></p>	</div>
