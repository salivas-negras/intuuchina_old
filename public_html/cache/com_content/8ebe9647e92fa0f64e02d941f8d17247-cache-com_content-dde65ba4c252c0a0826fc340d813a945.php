<p>How the Myers-Briggs Personality Test can help you Choose a Career</p>
<p>Deciding what career path to follow is probably the most stressful decision people can make, so where to start? Everyone finds what they&rsquo;re good at, what inspires them and what they loathe in due time but they have to start somewhere. Figuring your skills, values and ambitions in life are all deciding factors that can push and pull you in different directions. Another element to consider is your personality.</p>
<p>There are many personality tests that inform you of your strengths and weaknesses. One in particular is the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, also known as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. This personality test can be applied to your career development. Sometimes you may find that you have trouble defining what you&rsquo;re good at or comfortable doing, recognizing these can help narrow your choice of careers in the right direction. This practical tool measures your personality in four different areas: Extroversion vs. Introversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, Judging vs. Perception.</p>
<p>Extroversion vs. Introversion: This measures whether you prefer socializing and interacting with people (extroversion) or if it takes too much of your energy and enjoy spending time alone to unwind (Introversion).</p>
<p>Sensing vs. Intuition: This indicates whether you prefer specific facts and concrete details (Sensing) or focus more on hunches and the bigger picture (Intuition)</p>
<p>Thinking vs. Feeling: Thinking indicates you act on logical analysis and principles, whereas Feeling means you prefer to make decisions based on values and harmony.</p>
<p>Judging vs. Perception: If you prefer sticking to plans made ahead and act accordingly based on past experiences you are Judging and if you prefer to keep your options open as you go with flow you prefer Perception.</p>
<p>After taking this personality test you will receive your personality type based on these four areas. There are a total of 16 personality types you can receive. By clicking here you can view what characteristics are related to each of these personality types.</p>
<p>Understanding your personality type can assist your career development in various ways. It can not only help you select a career field that best matches your personality but it can raise your awareness on how you can market yourself and in evaluating what professional opportunities are worth taking. The Myers-Briggs Personality Test can also be useful as it helps employees understand one another.</p>
