<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;">It&rsquo;s always seemed a little peculiar that the letting go of 365 days and buckling down into new resolutions only required the strike of Midnight.&nbsp; With blasts of fireworks and pops of champagne, the Western hemisphere progresses through the solar calendar in as much time as the peck of a New Years Kiss. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;">Ringing in the Lunar New Year, however, is quite a bit more dramatic.&nbsp; Over the course of 15 days, China goes into holiday mode: a majority of stores, restaurants and offices close, families travel together, and fireworks are lit all day long.&nbsp; The new icon of the year, the Horse for 2014, becomes the most popular cartoon, adorning everything from red envelopes stuffed with money (hongbao) to special edition baijiu containers.&nbsp; Train stations, airports and highways experience record traffic as 3.62 billion passenger trips happened throughout China this year. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;">Concealing the holiday cheer this year, however, was a thick layer of concern about smog.&nbsp; It is no secret that China&rsquo;s air quality has worsened, or at least become a bigger worry, in recent months.&nbsp; With Shanghai and Beijing consistently posting AQI (air quality index) numbers above the healthy limits, government officials and environmental organizations encouraged people to cut back on the pyrotechnics.&nbsp; In fact, the LATimes.com reported that there was general support behind the extinguishment, with 81% of Shanghai respondents saying they supported a total ban.&nbsp; Exact figures on the number of booms aren&rsquo;t expected but we can say for certain that it&rsquo;s a Happy New Year. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;">Sending wishes for the best Year of the Horse from us at IntuuChina!! </span></p> 	</div>
