<p>Guanxi (关系) is at the very center of how the Chinese handle business. Foreigners who want to take advantage of China&rsquo;s booming economy must build guanxi with their business partners or they will have very temporary results if any at all. When the full concept is understood, acquiring guanxi might seem like common sense but to us foreigners who still have the wrong impression, the process can be intimidating. Looking back it is often easier to see our mistakes and not recognize our success so, with that in mind, here is a list of things to AVOID guanxi.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T learn Chinese. This one is easy. If you don&rsquo;t want to have a lasting business relationship, don&rsquo;t bother learning the language of your partners. It is still possible to make deals and agreements through English, the language of business, but these will be one-shot deals. You and your Chinese counterpart will remain names on a business card. Also, try to learn up to 10 words in the local dialect. Every region in China has its own peculiarities and knowing simple phrases never fails to impress. Even many Chinese don&rsquo;t know other dialects so being a foreigner with even the slightest familiarity will generate great interest as well as appreciation.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T participate in any Chinese social media (Wechat, Weibo, QQ). These apps and social media are reserved for friends and close contacts and are often the main source of communication between two people. Aside from personal communication it is also an integral part of a business strategy. Weibo has 600 million registered users so if you want exposure in China it is an absolute must.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T learn Chinese songs. This one may be a bit confusing for someone who has never been to China where karaoke is one of, if not the most, popular leisure activity. It is the most likely place your business partners will invite you and is a great chance to impress. If you know one single Chinese song from beginning to end you will make a very strong and lasting impression. It shows that you understand that singing is important to them as a people and that you took the time to learn a song that was part of their tradition instead of yours.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T befriend any Chinese. This one, again, seems obvious but it is very easy to find a group of other foreigners and become close with them. Especially in Shanghai and Beijing living in a bubble is very easy to do, meeting people from all over the West. Of course you may meet some great people but to get ahead in China you need to get out of your comfort zone. The habits and norms of a night out with Chinese can be very different and you want to learn these and show that you are already familiar with a local&rsquo;s night out.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T celebrate any Chinese holidays. This is a big one because we often feel intimidated by the family nature of these events and don&rsquo;t want to intrude but this is one of the best ways to show someone you care about them and that you understand and respect their culture. It should be said that it isn&rsquo;t necessary to stress over all the details of etiquette. As a foreigner the Chinese understand that you are not familiar with their culture and they will not be offended by these minor infractions but this also poses a great opportunity to impress. If you show that you understand their celebrations you will definitely leave a lasting impression. A large part of any celebration is the &ldquo;Hongbao&rdquo;. This is a red envelope with money inside given as a gift. To foreigners it may feel strange giving money but in China it is a tradition and also a direct sign of how closely you care about someone. Another large part of any celebration is food and there is always a specific dish involved for each holiday or celebration. Find out what it is and bring some as a gift. Not only will they appreciate any gift but they will be astonished to receive the appropriate gift from a foreigner. At meals pay respect to elders and wait to eat before they have had their fill. Again, this simple gesture shows you have taken the time to learn about your hosts and their culture.</p>
<p>If this all seems like common sense to you, you&rsquo;re right. This advice on what NOT to do should seem pretty intuitive but it is easy to be intimidated by China and it is easy to live in a comfortable bubble of foreign restaurants, bars and hangouts that prevent you from integrating with China. To acquire guanxi and become truly successful in China you need to get out of your comfort zone and make an effort to understand the people. Nothing is more flattering than knowing that someone understands and respects who you are and where you came from. You will find a business relationship will turn into a prosperous, lifelong friendship. Take the time to learn about a people and the return on your investment will be enormous.</p> 	</div>
