		<p>How the Myers-Briggs Personality Test can help you Choose a Career</p>
<p>Deciding what career path to follow is probably the most stressful decision people can make, so where to start? Everyone finds what they&rsquo;re good at, what inspires them and what they loathe in due time but they have to start somewhere. Figuring your skills, values and ambitions in life are all deciding factors that can push and pull you in different directions. Another element to consider is your personality.</p>
<p>There are many personality tests that inform you of your strengths and weaknesses. One in particular is the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, also known as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. This personality test can be applied to your career development. Sometimes you may find that you have trouble defining what you&rsquo;re good at or comfortable doing, recognizing these can help narrow your choice of careers in the right direction. This practical tool measures your personality in four different areas: Extroversion vs. Introversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, Judging vs. Perception.</p>
<p>Extroversion vs. Introversion: This measures whether you prefer socializing and interacting with people (extroversion) or if it takes too much of your energy and enjoy spending time alone to unwind (Introversion).</p>
<p>Sensing vs. Intuition: This indicates whether you prefer specific facts and concrete details (Sensing) or focus more on hunches and the bigger picture (Intuition)</p>
<p>Thinking vs. Feeling: Thinking indicates you act on logical analysis and principles, whereas Feeling means you prefer to make decisions based on values and harmony.</p>
<p>Judging vs. Perception: If you prefer sticking to plans made ahead and act accordingly based on past experiences you are Judging and if you prefer to keep your options open as you go with flow you prefer Perception.</p>
<p>After taking this personality test you will receive your personality type based on these four areas. There are a total of 16 personality types you can receive. By clicking here you can view what characteristics are related to each of these personality types.</p>
<p>Understanding your personality type can assist your career development in various ways. It can not only help you select a career field that best matches your personality but it can raise your awareness on how you can market yourself and in evaluating what professional opportunities are worth taking. The Myers-Briggs Personality Test can also be useful as it helps employees understand one another.</p>
<p>Here at IntuuChina we offer different types of internships in various sectors and we do our best to match your professional needs with companies you can grow from. While a various set of skills are needed in different internships, we will touch on some of the fundamental skills and characteristics needed to thrive in each sector in our blog posts to follow.</p>

		<p>Manuel Palhinha came to China after specializing in marketing, communication and advertising and has stood out in a highly competitive sector. He has acquired the experience and skills necessary to become a viable and highly sought candidate in any world market. Working for companies that target both Chinese and foreign consumers has given him the tools to make successful brands by inspiring and challenging him in a way only China can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living abroad is one of the most amazing experiences anyone can have. And mine has certainly changed me forever and offered me precious lessons for the future. I don&rsquo;t hesitate recommending this experience to any young talent seeking for opportunities in China. &ldquo;</p>
<p>China presents foreigners with unique opportunities to learn and develop, especially in marketing which is a fast growing sector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great professional experience to work in such a different context than most people are used to. The professionals that get out of their comfort zone and embrace challenges abroad will definitely develop great skills for their future professional career&hellip; Especially for young graphic designers, they can find here a lot of different visual Asian inspiration with China&rsquo;s vibrant culture and visual richness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Local talent that knows how to combine Chinese and Western insights has become harder to find. As China continues to move forward in leaps and bounds the need for foreign talent grows. Manuel and many others have gotten in on the ground floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China is currently one of the most dynamic business environments in the world. It has allowed me to ignite my communication, networking &amp; PR skills. China is the best place for that with its frenetic growing pace. I&acute;ve learned how to be independent and how to improvise in unexpected situations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young foreigners moving to China have all found that opportunities are abundant. If you look for opportunities and actively pursue them there is no limit to what can be accomplished. Manuel offers his advice on being successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trick to make effective advertising is surprise people with surprising messages&hellip; (Be) resilient and committed&hellip; at the end results will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through his greatest strength, persistence, Manuel has integrated himself into the booming business world of China and has built a name for himself as a highly motivated and successful marketer.</p>
<p>Getting your foot in the business world has become increasingly difficult. The world, however, has become much more accessible. China is quickly becoming a dominant economic power but is still bridging the gap between East and West and needs capable foreigners to do so. Connecting the two will be a monumental achievement in the business world and will shift the focus of global economics.</p>	</div>

		<p>While discussing with our HR department the importance of job interviews, we wondered about how job interviews came to be. A simple Google search led us to this footage from prehistoric times! Watch how job interviews were an essential part of figuring out who could help your tribe survive, much like today.</p>
<p>Although a comedy sketch taking place in hunting and gathering times, the simplified questions asked are references to questions we ask today.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What you do?&rdquo; &ndash; What are your skills? What skills do you have that we lack/need?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Where you see yourself in fifty moons times?&rdquo; &ndash; Where do you see yourself in 5 &ndash; 10 years? This is another question that is important to the tribe or company. They want a long-term commitment, someone they spend resources training in order to help them succeed years to come.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why you leave last tribe?&rdquo; &ndash; This question is sometimes asked before the interview, when you apply. If you got fired or left after just two years to travel (as this hunter and gather did) the company wants to know. Again, they don&rsquo;t want to waste their time and resources on someone who is going to leave spontaneously. Another issue this sketch points out in a hilarious way &ndash; do not lie. It&rsquo;s a small world, especially now with the invention of the World Wide Web.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Me Late. CV broke&rdquo; &ndash; Though not a question an interviewer asks, make sure to always be prepared. Don&rsquo;t show up late and then forget to bring your resume or any other paper work they may have asked of you prior your scheduled interview.</li>
</ul>

		<p>China&rsquo;s National Labor Day is every year on May 1st giving the mighty work force of China a long weekend. One of the major Chinese &ldquo;golden weekends&rdquo; around 41.2 million trips are expected to be made by train this year from April 30th to May 3rd. The Chinese people take advantage of extended weekends to make pilgrimages to landmarks and national parks creating a swarm of tourists in many urban locations</p>
<p>The number one spot for most rural Chinese people is The Forbidden City. If you live in Beijing try to avoid line 1 on the subway as it will be packed to the limit. Conveniently situated across from Tian&rsquo;an men square, tourists can soak up ancient history and communist party history.</p>
<p>National parks in China also see huge bumps in tourism as the weather turns nice and plant life blooms. Zhangjiajie national park is fast becoming the major outdoor destination for tourists. If you don&rsquo;t recognize the name look at the picture and see if it reminds you of a certain James Cameron movie. Zhangjiajie inspired Cameron&rsquo;s floating mountains in the movie Avatar and were prototypes before shooting the movie. The Chinese government was so taken by the director&rsquo;s set choice that they renamed one of the major peaks &ldquo;Hallelujah Mountain&rdquo; after the floating landscape in the movie.</p>
<p>And, of course, The Great Wall will be an unending line of sight seers slowly winding through the mountainous region north of Beijing. Busses and private cars shuttle endlessly along the highway between the city and the most famous wall in the world. Lines of people stretch as far as the wall itself during these peak tourist days and might be as impressive as the wall itself but infinitely more frustrating. Even the more adventurous tourists who hike out to remote sections will be surprised to find the lines of people have followed them across seemingly impassable terrain.</p>
<p>With the spike in tourism it might be a better idea to stay at home this weekend and catch up on some reading. If this is your last chance to see the many landmarks in China then be brave, be strong and be unrelenting when pushing your way through the incomparable crowds of tourists during this Golden Weekend!</p>	</div>
