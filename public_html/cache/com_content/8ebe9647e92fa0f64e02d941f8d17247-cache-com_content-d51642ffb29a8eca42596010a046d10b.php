<p>Ceci Wang, Senior Consultant at Stanton Chase International, provides added value to her company as a career coach. Many companies are investing in wellness programs and seeing dramatic results getting up to a 300% return on their investment through increased production, teamwork and even job satisfaction. On top of corporate wellness programs, Ceci works as a private career coach for everyone from executives trying sharpen their skills to new college graduates trying to start on the right path as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Job hunting is a challenge that involves a skill set all of its own. Many people don&rsquo;t know what tools they need to attract the right company or catch the eye of an employer. Other people don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re really looking for or even what they&rsquo;re good at. Just like learning an instrument or playing a sport there are people who can help. Career coaches are becoming common, equipping people with the right tools and the right mindset to go out and efficiently pursue a goal instead of throwing stacks of resumes at employers and hoping some stick.</p>
<p>A mix of coaching and counseling the goal is to identify a career path. This could mean finding an alternative career path or developing specific measurable steps to progress on a current career path. Some people know exactly what they want but don&rsquo;t know how to get there while others have no particular direction. In either case a career coach can show you the best approach.</p>
<p>A career coach will also assess any psychological, behavioral or emotional issues that might be holding a candidate back. Many times a person is highly qualified for a position but lacks the soft skills required. The interview is an especially important process that may not have any reflection on the job itself but, as they say, first impressions are everything. Simple things like body language and tone are often over looked but play a major role in presenting yourself. A career coach can help identify and correct these things.</p>
<p>Many times it is simply beneficial to talk things through with another individual. Our aspirations can often be confusing and disjointed but when they are vocalized certain aspects become obvious while others expose themselves for being illogical or incongruous. Vocalizing these inner thoughts becomes especially beneficial when the person listening is unbiased and honest. They will not spare you for your personal feelings and will not be influenced by past knowledge of you. Honesty is often a hard thing to come by.</p>
<p>The paperwork involved in a job search can be overwhelming. Knowing how to tailor a resume and write an effective cover letter for different positions can be critical as well as managing other resources such as LinkedIn. A career coach can show you how to get the most mileage out of all these but a warning: a career coach will NOT manage these things for you. They can show you the way but in the end it is up to you to move forward.</p>
<p>Everyone is looking for the &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; or a &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; but these are never the answer. It takes perseverance and dedication to advance. It takes a will to succeed and a refusal to quit. That does not mean you have to accomplish this alone. The greatest musicians had skilled teachers just like the greatest athletes had unrelenting coaches. The most successful employees had professional guidance.</p>
