<p>In this day and age, Google translate plays a very important role in our lives. It can be a very helpful companion but, as most people know, is far from 100% accurate. With Valentine&rsquo;s Day coming soon expats across Shanghai are brushing up on their repertoire of pillow talk and sweet nothings. The problem is Google translate might not be the best romantic coach.</p>
<p>I love you translates to &ldquo;我爱你&rdquo; (wǒ &agrave;i nǐ) which is fine except for one thing, Chinese people don&rsquo;t use this in everyday conversation if at all. But wait, you might be saying, every Chinese song says我爱你 like it was going out of style! This is true but just like &ldquo;baby&rdquo; is used in every song as often as is federally allowed under public decency laws, Americans don&rsquo;t walk down the street saying &ldquo;hey baby&rdquo; to everyone they meet.</p>
<p>For the Chinese it is too strong of a word. In a country that is generally very straight forward, issues of the heart can be a little more complex. Studies measuring electro activity in the brain support the idea that Chinese people respond to romance based on years of traditional conditioning.</p>
<p>Remember in grade school when telling a girl you like her was the same as saying you love her? Well bring out your backpack and pencil case because that&rsquo;s the preferred way in China. 我喜欢你 (wǒ xǐ huān nǐ) means &ldquo;I like you&rdquo;. Another evasive seduction is 我希望和你交往 (wǒ xī w&agrave;ng h&eacute; nǐ jiāo wǎng) which means &ldquo;I would for us to date&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When all else fails you can always rely on good old fashioned American charm and say &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo; in plain English (romantic music blaring out of a boom box is optional). Chinese people have begun using it themselves for its short sweetness and foreign obscurity.</p>
<p>However if you are really terrified of pledging your undying love aloud you can use China&rsquo;s new &ldquo;code&rdquo;. Chinese youth have begun texting numbers which closely resemble the sounds of certain phrases. For example 520 ((wǔ &egrave;r ling) sounds like &ldquo;我爱你&rdquo; (wǒ &agrave;i nǐ). 530 (wǔ sān l&iacute;ng) sounds like 我想你 (wǒ xiǎng nǐ) which means &ldquo;I miss you.&rdquo; And, my personal favorite, 770 (qī qī l&iacute;ng) sounds like 亲亲你 (qīn qīn nǐ) which means &ldquo;Kiss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So next time you fall hopelessly in love with a gorgeous local remember to hide your love away, until the moment is right of course, and be subtle. Next time you&rsquo;re at the bar maybe forego that drink and slide her a calculator with 520770 and watch her heart melt.</p> 	</div>
