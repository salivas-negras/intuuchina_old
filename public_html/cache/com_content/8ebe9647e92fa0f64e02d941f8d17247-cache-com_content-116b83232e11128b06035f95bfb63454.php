<p>Facebook office to open in Beijing</p>
<p>Although no official announcement has been made of the social network led by Mark Zuckerberg , an office of 800 square meters is finalizing preparations for the opening of his office building in the Beijing Fortune Financial Center.</p>
<p>These are the few details that have been leaked to the local press about one of the most anticipated landings in the digital world: the entry of Facebook in China. Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009 yet the Californian firm is in full pursuit of managers and employees of the subsidiary, as deduced from ads posted on his own website and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>The purpose of Facebook now is to provide services to the growing number of Chinese companies that are expanding abroad and using its web as an advertising platform. In addition, the U.S. company plans to expand its relations with the thousands of application developers in China, according to Vaughan Smith vice president.</p>
<p>Until now, Facebook provided all these services from its office in Hong Kong, which has its legal regime and is a relatively independent government from mainland China. The social network obtains the majority of its revenue by charging companies for hanging advertisements to its users. The enormous amount of data from users makes it a very attractive platform for advertisers. For example, Facebook can show you a hotel special ad for the weekend days before the birthday of your spouse.</p>
<p>The Californian firm has been eyeing the Chinese market for years since it&rsquo;s the country with the most Internet users in the world (over 600 million). Facebook has registered over 60 different brands and both Zuckerberg and other company executives have lavished on the Asian giant.</p>
<p>The disembarkment of the social network does not alter its status as banned in the communist regime. The Chinese cannot access Facebook unless they buy a proxy &ndash; a device or program that intercepts network connections a client makes on a server &ndash; to bypass censorship, a service that only a minority of citizens enjoys.</p>
<p>Even so, the opening of an office in Beijing has sparked all sorts of speculation. Some analysts believe that the ultimate goal of Facebook is to reach an agreement with a local firm to launch a social network that isn&rsquo;t censored and to therefore operate in the Asian giant.</p>
<p>Following LinkedIn</p>
<p>This is the path LinkedIn has recently followed. It has opened a Chinese website where comments, reviews and links have been deleted according to instructions from the government in Beijing. For example, numerous messages during the anniversary of Tiananmen on June 4 were removed from the professional platform.</p>
<p>Facebook has 390 million monthly active users in Asia, 30% of the total, and a turnover of 260 million euros in the continent (a total of 14%) in the first quarter of 2014, according to official data of the company .</p>
